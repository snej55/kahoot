## Kahoot bot generator

These scripts use the [KahootPY](https://github.com/vehbiu/kahoot-py/tree/main) library. You can install it with:

```
pip install -U KahootPY
```

### The different scripts:

 - `main.py` asks you to enter a text (song lyrics, etc), and then generates a new bot for each word.
 - `names.py` generates a specified number of bots with random names & usernames.
